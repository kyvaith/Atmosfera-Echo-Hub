- ESP-IDF framework.
- LVGL-based interface.
- 32-bit LVGL color pipeline using RGB888 output.
- PPA-accelerated rendering.
- MIPI DSI display output.
- Touch input.
- SendSpin media source and multiroom group control.
- I2S audio output through an external DAC.
- Music Assistant-oriented now-playing UI.
- OTA and USB flashing workflow.

## Development

### Architecture and contributor guide

Start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing the firmware. The complete
runtime and extension documentation is split by subsystem:

- [Runtime architecture overview](docs/architecture/README.md)
- [Graphics, MIPI DSI, DMA2D, PPA, JPEG, and buffer ownership](docs/architecture/graphics.md)
- [Navigation, Home snapshots, applications, and Settings scrolling](docs/architecture/navigation-snapshots.md)
- [Audio, full duplex, AEC, and voice assistant](docs/architecture/audio-voice.md)
- [Runtime tasks, PSRAM, and memory lifecycles](docs/architecture/runtime-memory.md)
- [Architecture decision log](docs/architecture/decisions.md)
- [Adding pages, applications, lists, and direct widgets](docs/development/extending-ui.md)
- [Build, hardware validation, and regression checklist](docs/development/validation.md)
- [Productionization and upstream migration roadmap](docs/productization.md)

The architecture guide explicitly distinguishes reusable behavior from
Atmosfera-specific layout and policy. New views must register with navigation,
snapshot, and lifecycle components; merely adding an LVGL page does not make
it snapshot-aware.

### Build and upload

The firmware is built with ESPHome:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\esphome.exe compile atmosfera-echo-hub.yaml
```

Upload over USB:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\esphome.exe upload atmosfera-echo-hub.yaml --device COM5
```

Upload over OTA:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\esphome.exe upload atmosfera-echo-hub.yaml --device atmosfera-echo-hub.local
```

The project is intentionally ESPHome-native. The best parts of it should remain easy to inspect, fork, flash, extend, and repair.

## Project Status

Atmosfera Echo Hub is an ambitious, product-grade smart home satellite concept in active development. The goal is to combine the openness of ESPHome with the polish of a premium consumer device: powerful enough for enthusiasts, approachable enough for daily household use, and hackable enough to become whatever your home needs next.
